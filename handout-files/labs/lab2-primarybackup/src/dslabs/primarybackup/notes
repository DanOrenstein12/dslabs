App copying:
get info into backup
send request until it gets a reply
we have this

Backup:



Multiples cases:
case 1 is when the primary is still alive but the backup dies

primary will continue to send the copy message until it gets a response

handleviewreply is going to have logic for making sure that the primary anhd backup are the same as before otherwise do the changing behavior

Changing behavior: if the primary has died and there is a backup then we have the backup become the primary and assign a new backup via the viewserver. Nothing special happens in this case.
primary will never die when there is no backup

if backup dies then we need to copy the primary application
Questions: what is the behavior of hte primary while this is happening? Need a response on piazza before building this
Possiblilities: wait for the backup to finish processing the app then start handling new shit
handle new shit then whent he backup is done the view will be updated and suddenly the primary will dump its load --> no new code for this case

backup dies and there is no replacement, the primary doesnt forward anything and just replies to clients

timers: pings
primary resending requests to the backup
shouldnt need multiple for different types of requests

shitload of new messages
copying
pings
FORWARD REQUESst

forwardreply
replying
